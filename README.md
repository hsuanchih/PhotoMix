# PhotoMix

PhotoMix allows multiple photos to be placed onto a photo canvas.  
Users can pick photos from the photo album, or snap photos real-time.  
Photos added to the canvas can be resized, rotated and removed on-the-fly to facilitate visual composition.  
The canvas can be saved to the photo album (and shared to social media).
